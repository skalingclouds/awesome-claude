## Quick Start

### For contributors

Option A (recommended): open [Submit](https://heyclau.de/submit) and use the category issue form.

Option B (direct): open a category issue form in GitHub under `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE`.

Option C (advanced): open a pull request with content files directly.

Free Claude resources use issue-first intake by default. Fully valid,
source-backed, non-artifact submissions can auto-open an import PR after policy
gates pass. Maintainer review still gates merge.
Tool/app/service
promotion, listing claims, and jobs use the website lead forms instead of GitHub
content issues.

### Claim or update an entry

- Use [Claim/update listing](https://heyclau.de/claim) for ownership or commercial listing updates.
- Use detail-page "Edit on GitHub" links for direct source edits.
- Use detail-page "Suggest change" links for issue-first corrections.

1. Add or update a file under `content/<category>/`
2. Run `pnpm --filter web run prebuild`
3. Run `pnpm validate:content:strict`, `pnpm validate:issue-templates`, `pnpm validate:packages`, `pnpm scan:packages`, `pnpm validate:clean`, `pnpm audit:content`, `pnpm validate:emails`, `pnpm validate:raycast-feed`, `pnpm test:mcp`, `pnpm test:registry-artifacts`, `pnpm test:seo-jsonld`, `pnpm test:commercial-intake`, `MCP_ENDPOINT_URL=http://localhost:3000/api/mcp pnpm --filter @heyclaude/mcp validate:endpoint`, and `pnpm build`
4. Run `pnpm generate:issue-templates` if registry categories changed
5. Commit generated registry artifacts only from maintainer/internal branches

`README.md`, `apps/web/public/data/**`, `apps/web/src/generated/**`, and
`apps/web/public/downloads/**` are generated or maintainer-owned outputs.
Direct contributors should not edit them in content PRs.

Community submissions may link to source repositories, documentation, install
commands, or full copyable content. Community-submitted ZIP/MCPB packages are
not published as HeyClaude-hosted downloads. Maintainer-built convenience
packages use checksums and package trust metadata after review.
