# API Security Contract

HeyClaude exposes a public read-only registry API plus a small set of limited
dynamic endpoints. Registry publishing is not exposed over the public API.

## Public Read-Only Surfaces

- `/api/registry/manifest`
- `/api/registry/categories`
- `/api/registry/search`
- `/api/registry/feed`
- `/api/registry/diff`
- `/api/registry/entries/{category}/{slug}`
- `/api/registry/entries/{category}/{slug}/llms`
- `/api/mcp`
- `/data/*.json` registry artifacts
- `/data/feeds/index.json`
- `/data/feeds/categories/{category}.json`
- `/data/feeds/platforms/{platform}.json`
- `/data/skill-adapters/...` generated adapters
- `/feed.xml` and static registry changelog artifacts

## Limited Dynamic Surfaces

- `/api/votes/query`
- `/api/votes/toggle`
- `/api/community-signals`
- `/api/community-signals/query`
- `/api/intent-events`
- `/api/newsletter/subscribe`
- `/api/newsletter/webhook`
- `/api/og`
- `/api/submissions`
- `/api/listing-leads`
- `/api/admin/listing-leads`
- `/api/admin/jobs`
- `/api/admin/jobs/health`

## Controls

- API route contracts live in `apps/web/src/lib/api/contracts.ts`. Route files
  under `apps/web/src/app/api/**` are thin adapters that delegate to the central
  router in `apps/web/src/lib/api/router.ts`.
- Request params, queries, and JSON bodies are validated with Zod. The generated
  OpenAPI document in `cloudflare/api-schema-heyclaude-openapi.yaml` is derived
  from those Zod contracts with `pnpm generate:openapi` and checked with
  `pnpm validate:openapi`.
- API errors use one normalized envelope:
  `{ ok: false, error: { code, message, details? }, requestId? }`.
- Public browser-facing endpoints keep origin checks and route-level rate limits.
- JSON writes require content-type validation and payload size limits.
- Admin review endpoints require bearer or admin-token headers.
- Webhooks require provider signatures when configured.
- Newsletter template syncing is a local operator script that talks to Resend
  Templates only; the public site does not expose campaign-send, scheduling, or
  template-management endpoints.
- Website submissions require origin checks, payload limits, schema validation,
  honeypot discard logging, existing-content duplicate checks, pending
  GitHub-issue duplicate checks, and GitHub issue creation only.
- Website submissions do not accept or publish package uploads. Community
  ZIP/MCPB artifacts are review/quarantine material only; public downloads are
  maintainer-built artifacts after review.
- Production submissions should set `SUBMISSIONS_REQUIRE_TURNSTILE=1` and
  `TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY`; if the requirement is enabled without a secret, the
  endpoint fails closed instead of accepting direct website submissions.
- Cloudflare rate-limit bindings are configured for registry, dynamic, strict,
  and MCP routes. The public no-key MCP endpoint uses a dedicated
  `API_MCP_RATE_LIMIT` binding with a `60 requests/minute/IP` production cap.
  In-process limits remain a local/dev fallback when the Worker binding is
  unavailable.
- Next and Worker responses attach security headers in code as well as static
  asset headers: CSP, HSTS, `X-Frame-Options`, `X-Content-Type-Options`,
  `Referrer-Policy`, `Permissions-Policy`, and `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy`.
- No endpoint may import content into the registry, create pull requests, or
  publish submissions directly. GitHub automation may auto-open PRs for
  source-backed submissions after policy gates pass, and maintainer review still
  gates merge.
- Job lead intake is intentionally shallow. Paid job publication remains gated
  by the token-protected D1 admin flow, which requires enriched reviewed listing
  content before active paid rows can publish.

## Registry Trust Fields

Registry feeds and entry detail payloads may include `trustSignals` derived from
existing file-backed facts:

- package verification flags, first-party/external trust, and package SHA256
- source URLs already present on the entry
- content/repository/verification timestamps already present on the entry
- generated adapter status and platform compatibility

These fields are factual metadata, not paid ranking or live health claims. Live
link health checks can be added later as a separate generated artifact once they
are backed by a real checker.
